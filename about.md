title: About Early Intervention See-Saw
---
## Welcome to the Early Intervention See-Saw blog!

This blog was developed to share some of the highs and lows of early intervention from a parent's perspective. As a parent of a child with a global development delay, planning and motor coordination difficulties, microcephaly and gene deletion, early intervention is a large part of my life. Therapy is not limited to appointments, but looms, waiting for integration, over every activity. The (largely self imposed) pressure to maximise opportunities for your child's learning and development shapes life and family priorities in unexpected ways, not all of which are negative.  This journey is one being made by so many parents, and yet blogs tend to focus on their child's diagnosis and life as a carer. This blog attempts to provide another viewpoint, looking at how engagement with services can strengthen or weaken outcomes for the whole family. It's all pretty new to me, so thank you for coming along on our journey. I'd love to hear of the experiences and insights of others along the way.
