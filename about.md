### Welcome to the Early Intervention See-Saw blog!

This blog was developed to share some of the highs and lows of early intervention (EI) from a parent's perspective. As a parent of a child with a global development delay, planning and motor coordination difficulties, microcephaly and gene deletion, early intervention is a large part of my family's life. Therapy is not limited to appointments, but looms, waiting for integration, over every activity. The (largely self imposed) pressure to maximise opportunities for your child's learning and development shapes life and family priorities in unexpected ways, not all of which are negative.  We rely so much on early intervention services, in fact these services are critical, not only to providing advice and guidance for our work with our children, but in connecting us to others in similar situations to share, accept and learn.

This journey is one being made by so many parents, and yet there does not seem to be enough attention on these services, their standards, and the trials and tribulations association with accessing and them. This blog shares the experiences of our family, and hopefully others too if they feel like sharing. Its not a moan and bitch, well not all the time. Its a celebration, exploration, questioning, dreaming, wondering and speculating kind of space. And maybe this might help clarify my thinking, fight for necessary improvements and celebrate best practice.  This world of disability services is all pretty new to me, so thank you for coming along on our journey. I hope to hear your stories along the way.
