title: About Early Intervention See-Saw
---
### Welcome to the Early Intervention See-Saw blog!

This blog was developed to share some of the highs and lows of early intervention from a parent's perspective. As a parent of a child with a global development delay, planning and motor coordination difficulties, microcephaly and gene deletion, early intervention is a large part of my family's life. Therapy is not limited to appointments, but looms, waiting for integration, over every activity. The (largely self imposed) pressure to maximise opportunities for your child's learning and development shapes life and family priorities in unexpected ways, not all of which are negative.  We rely so much on early intervention services, in fact these services are critical, not only to providing advice and guidance for our work with our children, but in connecting us to others in similar situations to share, accept and learn.

This journey is one being made by so many parents, and yet blogs tend to focus on disability, diagnosis and life as a carer. This blog attempts to provide another viewpoint, looking at how engagement with services can strengthen or weaken outcomes for the whole family. It is written for parents on similar journeys and hopefully will feature numerous stories, not just ours. It is also written for practitioners who may wish to understand the emotional and other implications of various service delivery modes and outcomes. It is also written for the sake of my own mental health; sometimes collective celebration or catharsis is needed to move foreward. This world of disability services is all pretty new to me, so thank you for coming along on our journey. Hope to hear your stories along the way.
