After a year of therapy through the local health system, the promise of Better Start funding has meant my son now has access to subsidized non-government services. I feel vaguely excited about the idea. I find a well-reputed, nonprofit service provider, and a Key Worker (coordinator, contact point and multidisciplinary therapist) is appointed.

Our first session, which took place in my house, was, shall I say, ‘interesting’. The purpose, I was told, was to kick start the planning process for my son’s use of the service (and others), and the worker boldly declared on arrival that she was there to ‘empower’ me in this process. OK, I’m feeling pretty empowered already and I’m not sure what we’re planning, but I am prepared to give it a go. Bring it on. 

To get the ball rolling, I tell the worker our immediate goals for our son: walking and talking, and I list out the current activities we are doing to progress these goals. Not so unusual I would think, but the worker seems stumped. Too big a goal perhaps, should we break it down? Hmmm, my Key Worker seems to prefer sitting in awkward half silence, casting me the occassional doe eyed look. She struggles to answer my questions, and deflects attention by doting on my youngest, who admittedly is pretty cute. My son, who is the subject of these sessions, gets a cursory glance.

I’m confused. What happened to working with me to identify our intervention priorities, and to create a plan to address these? Or even some basic intervention for my son?

I had to push her out the door after over an hour of her ‘empowerment’. I was left feeling pretty frustrated, offended and confused - was this standard practice? What the hell was she thinking I was getting out of it? Tell me this is not the future of our early intervention.

I filter through possible reasons for the session’s outcome. Perhaps it’s her first attempt at Key Working. She was young and probably inexperienced, has anyone trained her in people skills and a planning methodology?  I can see a lot of online training courses around for Key Workers, has she had access to one of those? How about practical experience and support from her organisation?

Perhaps she stayed quiet so I could speak in a misguided attempt to provide an “empowering environment”. Such lofty goals, it can be pretty hard to understand how they apply in practice. I’ve been in that space in a previous work role, I get how difficult it is to know how to act in an unequal relationship. But, if that is the case, take my advice. Yay to being committed to my empowerment, but: a) check in with me - am I even disempowered? Ah, NO; b) Maybe I’m just being a pedant, but just a little clarification for the record, empowerment is not something you do to someone - it is something someone achieves for themselves with the appropriate supports, and; c) Don’t equate the empowerment process to providing space to be heard. As a parent/ carer I need information, mutual respect, opportunities and advice. I need to understand the system and what questions I need to ask and decisions I need to make. I am buggered, my daughter is young, I can’t remember when I had a good night sleep.  Help me out here. And don’t do that “you are the expert” crap. Hell yes, I know my son, but you have skills too. What am I paying you for if not to access these? 

The more I think about it, the more disempowered SHE seems. No experience, and to make matters worse, she doesn’t even value her own skills, so how does she have any hope? Should I be helping her out, perhaps a mentor program? God, GET A GRIP I silently scream. Stay focused. 

And then I start thinking, is it even fair to expect that this key worker could deliver the quality of service equivalent to my three former therapists? Have I been duped by the system, giving up my therapists, each of whom give an hour a session, for a Key Worker who attempts to do everything in the same time? In fact, she is expected to do more than a therapist - coordinate input from multiple therapists, plan, advise and support me as a parent. Achievable? Hmmm, that would take a pretty special person. No wonder I am irritated.

Responsibility weighs heavily on a parent of a disabled child. I am trying to max out every opportunity to work that neuroplasticity before school starts. Waste my time and I’ll get angry.

How’s that for empowerment? 

Needless to say, I have requested a new Key Worker. I do wonder, however, what type of organisation would put such an inexperienced person in a critical front line role? [In the back of my mind: God, who have I picked? Red lights flashing, Abort, Abort].

So tell me dear reader, assuming that shortly I have some (this being my first post): Are there supported, skilled and talented Key Workers out there or is my first encounter with the “system” indicative of a broader problem brought on by tight budgets and/or poor recruitment? Do any agencies monitor and evaluate their Key Worker programs to prevent under performance? Should I run back to my therapists and refuse to give them up?
