After a year seeing individual Speech Therapists, Occupational therapists and Physios, we are being farmed from the public into the private/non-governmental system on the basis that we are likely to get Better Start funding. Cause for celebration? After my recent meeting with my new Key Worker (coordinator, contact point and therapist), I'm not entirely certain. 

Our first session was *interesting*. Ok I'm being generous, there was nothing interesting about it. The Key Worker advised me on arrival that she was there to "empower me", and that we could take up to 6 sessions to plan all that must be planned. OK, I'm feeling pretty empowered already (after all didn't I organise this session?) and I'm not sure what we'll be planning that will take so long, but I am cool with it, **BRING IT ON**. 

I tell the worker our goals for our son, after which she spends approximately 1 hour sitting in awkward half silence, casting me the occasional doe eyed look, whilst struggling to answer my questions and doting on my youngest, who admittedly is pretty cute. My son, who is the subject of these sessions gets a cursory glance. I'm confused. What happened to working with me to identify our intervention priorities, and to create a plan to address these? Or even some basic intervention for my son?

I had to push her out the door, and was left feeling pretty frustrated, offended and confused - was this standard practice? What the hell was she thinking I was getting out of it? Tell me this is not the future of our early intervention.

So, what exactly went wrong?

I can only imagine, and since unpacking infinite possibilities is a favourite pastime, I go right ahead and do so..

OK, so perhaps the session was her first attempt at Key Working (I prefer to follow this line of thinking rather than assuming incompetence). Yeah, I'm thinking, she was young and probably inexperienced. Did anyone train her in people skills and planning methodology?  I can see a lot of online training courses around, she probably did one of those. But did her organisation support her and give her practical experience before being sent off to meet parents?  Hey, wait a moment. What type of organisation would put an inexperienced person in a critical front line role? [in the back of my mind: God, who have I picked? Red lights flashing, abort, abort]. Don't they know we will eat her alive? Responsibility weighs heavily. I am trying to max out every opportunity to work that Nero plasticity before school starts. Waste my time and I'll get angry. 

How's that for empowerment, sister? 

Or, I start thinking, maybe she stayed quiet so I could speak in a misguided attempt to provide an *empowering environment*. Such lofty goals, pretty hard to understand how they apply in practice. I've been in that space in a previous work role, I get how difficult it is to know how to act in an unequal relationship. But, if that is the case, take my advice. Yay to being committed to my empowerment, but: a) check in with me - am I even dis empowered? Ah, NO; b) Maybe I'm just being a pedant, but just a little clarification for the record, empowerment is not something you do to someone - it is something someone achieves for themselves with the appropriate supports, and; c) Don't equate the process to empowerment as providing space to be heard. As a parent/carer I need information, mutual respect, opportunities and advice. I need to understand the system and what questions I need to ask. I am buggered, my daughter is young, I can't remember when I had a good night sleep.  Help me out here. And don't do that *you are the expert* crap. Hell yes, I know my son, but you have skills too. What am I paying you for if not to access these? 

And that's it. The more I think about it, the more disempowered she seems. No experience, and then to add insult to injury, she doesn't even value her own skills, so how does she have any hope? Should I be helping her out, perhaps a mentor program? God, GET A GRIP I scream. Stay focused. 

And then I start thinking is it even fair to expect that a key worker could deliver in the same way as individualised sessions with therapist? In fact they are expected to do more than a therapist - coordinate input from multiple therapists, plan, advise and support parents. No wonder I was irritated. Achievable? Hmmm, that would take a pretty special person. 

So tell me dear reader, assuming that shortly I have some, this being my first post: Are there supported, skilled and talented Key Workers out there or is my first encounter with the **system** indicative of a broader problem brought on by tight budgets and/or poor recruitment? Do any agencies monitor and evaluate their Key Worker programs to track progress and prevent under performance? Is there a risk of this supposedly empowering program serving to disempower both the parent/carers and/or the worker themselves?
